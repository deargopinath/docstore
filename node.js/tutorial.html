<a name=howto><h2>How to Run the Tutorial</h2>
The Readme in the Github repository swdavey/docstore details how to install the tutorial.<p>

The purpose of this tutorial is to get used to coding XDevAPI methods in a real-world context (well nearly real-world, the code is very
basic so that you can understand what is going on; don't copy it and use it in production!).<p>

To run the tutorial we would suggest you use three or four terminals as follows:
<ol>
<li>To edit the index.js code.</li>
<li>To run the code - remember to restart after you have made edits!</li>
<li>To run the cURL commands.</li>
<li>To run mysql shell (optional) - it may help to query the schema through mysql shell whilst you are working.</li>
</ol>

The <b>index.js</b> file is mostly complete but requires you to code XDevAPI snippets. In order that the uncoded snippets don't cause the code to fail each exercise
segment is commented and the exercises run top to bottom. You should only remove the comment when you come to do the exercise. For example, removing the commented line<pre>
/* Exercise 1 
</pre>
will allow you to work on "Exercise 1" whilst leaving all the other unfinished exercises commented.<p>


To run the code (which is a webserver that waits for REST (http) calls) change directory to the node project (for our purposes assume
it is /home/stuart/dev/tutorial) and then run as follows:
<pre>
cd /home/stuart/dev/tutorial
node index.js
</pre>
You should see a message that a webserver is listening on port 3000 (unless of course you changed the port)<p>

To test the code, change into the test directory (from the project's home directory). From here you will run cURL commands. 
For the most part it is not necessary to be in this directory but some of the tests will require you to use the json files that reside 
in it. Test that the server is working by running the cURL command:<pre>
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/nycfood/boroughs | jq
</pre>
You should see a list of the boroughs of New York printed out. Note: the "|" (pipe) into jq is only available on Linux and 
pretty-prints the output in JSON format. If using Windows omit the pipe and jq from your command.

<a name=exercises><h2>Exercises</h2>
<h3>Exercise 1: Get a List of Sorted Cuisines</h3>
Read about the <a href=#findFunction>find()</a> method, then complete the body of the following function: 
<pre>
    app.get('/nycfood/cuisines', async function(req,res) {
  
    });
</pre>
Your code should be similar to that of that of <font face='monospace'>app.get('/nycfood/boroughs', async function(req, res) { ... })</font>. You 
will probably get the most out of this exercise by typing the text rather than cutting and pasting because typing will mean you 
read the code.<p>
<b>Testing</b><br>
Remember to save your work and then restart the program (i.e. node index.js)<br>
Enter the command<pre>
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/nycfood/cuisines | jq
</pre>
You should see a list of approximately 70 different cuisines in alphabetical order.
<hr>


<h3>Exercise 2: Get an Abbreviated List of all Outlets in New York</h3>
For this exercise most of the typing has been done for you. Your task is to code a chained <a href=#findMethod>find()</a> request that 
will display a subset of the <a href=#findFunction>fields</a> of each outlet and to sort the outlets in borough, cuisine, name order. 
Don't worry about binding variables - that will be covered in the next exercise. The output should be an array (list) of objects of the form:<pre>
[
    {
        "_id": value,
        "borough": value,
        "cuisine": value,
        "name": value
    },
    {
        "_id": value,
        "borough": value,
        "cuisine": value,
        "name": value
    },
	...
]
</pre>
The order of the fields within each object does not matter, but the objects themselves should be sorted on borough, cuisine and 
name, such that all outlets for Manhatten will be displayed before Staten Island, and within a borough American cuisine will come 
before French, and an outlet named "Aardvark" will come before one called "Zebra".<p> 

<b>Testing</b><br>
Remember to save your work and then restart the program (i.e. node index.js)<br>
Enter the command<pre>
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/nycfood/outlets | jq
</pre>
<hr>


<h3>Exercise 3: Get the Details of an Individual Outlet; Use binding</h3>
Prepared Statements, sometimes called <it>Parametized Statements</it> provide the database with SQL templates that it can parse and optimize prior to it receiving real requests.
The Prepared statements provide placeholders for the values that will be used. When we come to use a Prepared Statement we bind values to these placeholders.<p>

In this exercise use the bind() method to parametize the _id of the outlet you are 
<a href=#findMethod>searching</a> for.<p>

<b>Testing</b><br>
Remember to save your work and then restart the program (i.e. node index.js)<br>
Enter the command (do not put the _id in quotes)<pre>
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/nycfood/outlet/<font color=red>&lt_id-of-chosen-doc&gt</font> | jq
</pre>
You should see a document detailing all the fields of the outlet identified by _id.
<hr>


<h3>Exercise 4: Create a New Outlet</h3>
<a href=#addMethod>Creating</a> a new outlet is potentially the easiest of all the tasks. When coding in node.js there is 
no need for the execute() to have a callback function because a no documents are being returned (as per a find() operation); 
all the information regarding the success or failure of the operation will be returned in a results object.<p> 

<b>Testing</b><br>
Remember to save your work and then restart the program (i.e. node index.js)<br>
Make sure you are in the directory /home/opc/dev/node/test, then print the create.json file so that you can see what is about to be POSTed:<pre>
cat create.json
</pre>
Now enter the command<pre>
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d @create.json http://localhost:3000/nycfood/create | jq
</pre>
From the response, extract the id and then run:<pre>
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/nycfood/outlet/<font color=red>&lt_id-of-new-doc&gt</font> | jq
</pre> 
You should see your new document which details all its fields. Note down the _id value.
<hr>


<h3>Exercise 5: Remove an Outlet</h3>
In order to <a href=#removeMethod>remove</a> an outlet you must provide some search criteria. For this exercise use _id because 
we know that each outlet will have a unique _id (and so we won't inadvertently remove a wrong outlet). You should use a bind() 
variable for the _id.<p> 

<b>Testing</b><br>
Remember to save your work and then restart the program (i.e. node index.js)<br>
Take the _id of the document you have just created and then add it to the following cURL command and then run the command
<pre>
curl -X DELETE -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d'{"id": <font color=red>"&lt_id&gt"</font>}'  http://localhost:3000/nycfood/remove | jq
</pre>
You should see that no documents have been affected.
Check that it has been removed by running:<pre>
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/nycfood/outlet/&lt_id&gt | jq
</pre>
Nothing other than an empty array [] should be returned.
<hr>


<h3>Exercise 6: (Update) Grade an Outlet</h3>
If you look at an outlet you will see that each one has an array of gradings:<pre>

    {
	    "_id": "123456780..."
        ...
        "grades": [{
            "time": {
                "$time": 1498...
            },
            "grade": "A",
            "score": 10
        },{
            "time": {
                "$time": 1495...
            },
            "grade": "A",
            "score" : 7
        }]
	    ...
    }
	
</pre>
Your task is to <a href=#modifyMethod>update</a> an outlet (specified by an _id) with a new grading.<p> 

<b>Testing</b><br>
Remember to save your work and then restart the program (i.e. node index.js)<br>
Assuming you deleted your created document, re-create it<pre>
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d @create.json http://localhost:3000/nycfood/create | jq
</pre>
Take the new _id and list it:<pre>
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/nycfood/outlet/<font color=red>&lt_id-of-new-doc&gt</font> | jq
</pre>
You will note that the grades array is empty. Update it (twice):<pre>
curl -X PATCH -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d'{"id": <font color=red>"&lt_id&gt"</font>, "grade": "A", "score": 10}' http://localhost:3000/nycfood/grade | jq
curl -X PATCH -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d'{"id": <font color=red>"&lt_id&gt"</font>, "grade": "B", "score": 7}' http://localhost:3000/nycfood/grade | jq
</pre>
Now list it again:<pre>
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/nycfood/outlet/<font color=red>&lt_id-of-new-doc&gt</font> | jq
</pre>
You should see the gradings
<hr>


<h3>Exercise 7: Bonus Points for Reading! Update an Outlet using Single Document Operations</h3> 
Uncomment and read the code (remember to remove the closing comment */). Note how the getOne() and replaceOne() methods simplify the CRUD XdevAPI interface further. Note also
that this PUT method can change all of the values other than the ID.<p>

<b>Testing</b><br>
Remember to save your work and then restart the program (i.e. node index.js)<br>
Assume Welsh cuisine has fallen out of favour, and the inhabitants of Manhatten are seeking to go back to their Dutch roots. Print
the update.json file in order to see how we are going to change the Welsh restaurant into a Dutch one. Note that you will have
to edit this file, replacing the value for id with the _id of your document.<pre>
cat update.json
nano update.json  (replace id value)
curl -X PUT -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d @update.json http://localhost:3000/nycfood/update | jq
</pre>
List it again and you should see that the outlet is now Dutch!<pre>
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/nycfood/outlet/<font color=red>&lt_id-of-new-doc&gt</font> | jq
</pre>
Grade it if you wish:
<pre>
curl -X PATCH -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d'{"id": <font color=red>"&lt_id&gt"</font>, "grade": "A", "score": 10}' http://localhost:3000/nycfood/grade | jq
</pre>

<a name=docs><h2>CRUD Collection Operations</h2>
The following documentation should allow you to complete the tutorial. Full documentation can be found in the <a href=https://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en/>XdevAPI User Guide</a>.
Specific command documentation can be found in its <a href=https://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en/mysql-x-crud-ebnf-definitions.html>CRUD EBNF</a> section.
<hr>

<a name=addFunction><h3>Create => add()</h3>
<b><pre>
    CollectionAddFunction
      ::= ( '.add(' ( DocumentOrJSON | '[' DocumentOrJSON ( ',' DocumentOrJSON )* ']' )? ')' )+ 
          ( '.execute()' )?
</pre></b>
<p>
<b>Examples:</b><br>
In all cases assume a collection object, myCol, has been retrieved from the session.
<pre>
    myCol.add({"name": "fred",  "age": 30, "intelligent": false}).execute();

    myCol.add([{"name": "barney",  "age": 30, "intelligent": false},{"name": "betty",  "age": 24, "intelligent": true}]).execute();
  
    var wobj = {"name": "wilma",  "age": 28, "intelligent": true);
    myCol.add(wobj).execute();
</pre>
<b>Notes:</b><br> 
There are no other chaining methods, not even bind().<br>
For reasons of clarity the above examples detail node.js code <b>without</b> the use of Promises. In the real world this 
code will need to be wrapped by either traditional Promise code or the new async-await syntax.<br>
The return value from the execute() will detail how many rows and items have been affected and provide any auto-generated Ids (_id) in
an array. It will also provide a count of warnings and a corresponding array of warning strings with severity levels.

<a name=findFunction><h3>Read => find()</h3>
<b><pre>
    CollectionFindFunction
      ::= '.find(' SearchConditionStr? ')' ( '.fields(' ProjectedDocumentExprStr ')' )?
        ( '.groupBy(' SearchExprStrList ')' )? ( '.having(' SearchConditionStr ')' )?
        ( '.sort(' SortExprStrList ')' )? ( '.limit(' NumberOfRows ')' ( '.offset(' NumberOfRows ')' )? )?
        ( '.lockExclusive(' LockContention ')' | '.lockShared(' LockContention ')' )? 
        ( '.bind(' PlaceholderValues ')' )*
        ( '.execute()' )?
</pre></b>
<b>Examples:</b><br>
In all cases assume a collection object, myCol, has been retrieved from the session.<br>
Pay particular attention to how quotes have been used.
<pre>
    myCol.find().execute();                           // returns all documents in the collection

    myCol.find().sort("name").execute();              // returns all documents sorted in order of "name" value ascending

    myCol.find().sort("name","age desc").execute();   // returns all documents sorted in order 
                                                      // of "name" value ascending, then age (oldest - youngest)

    myCol.find('name = "fred"').execute();            // returns all documents that have the key "name" and value "fred"

    myCol.find('age > 25').execute();                 // returns all documents 

    myCol.find().fields(["name","age"]).execute();    // returns all documents but only displays the keys and values for the fields shown    
</pre>
<b>Notes:</b><br> 
For reasons of clarity the above examples detail node.js code <b>without</b> the use of Promises. In the real world this 
code will need to be wrapped by either traditional Promise code or the new async-await syntax.<br>
In the case of node.js, the return value from the execute() will detail how many rows and items have been affected as well as providing a 
count of warnings and a corresponding array of warning strings with severity levels. The actual results set (the "returned" documents) 
will be accessible through a callback function, e.g.
<pre>
    var myArray = [];
    // the await syntax waits for the asynchronous call to complete so allowing sequentially ordered code execution
    var result = await myCol.find().execute(function(doc) {
        myArray.push(doc);
    });

    // use result object
    if (result.warningsCount > 0) {
        // do something
    }
	
    // use myArray object
    for (myElem of myArray) {
        console.log(myElem);
    }
</pre> 
The node.js case is different from every other language (including "vanilla" JavaScript) where the results object is returned in
the normal manner. For example in PHP
<pre>
    $res = $myCol->find()->execute();
    print(json_encode($res->fetchAll()));
</pre>

<a name=modifyFunction><h3>Update => modify()</h3>
<b><pre>
    CollectionModifyFunction
      ::= '.modify(' SearchConditionStr ')'
        ( '.set(' CollectionField ',' ExprOrLiteral ')' |
          '.unset(' CollectionFields ')' |
          '.arrayInsert(' CollectionField ',' ExprOrLiteral ')' |
          '.arrayAppend(' CollectionField ',' ExprOrLiteral ')' |
          '.arrayDelete(' CollectionField ')' |
          '.patch(' DocumentOrJSON ')'
        )+
        ( '.sort(' SortExprStrList ')' )? ( '.limit(' NumberOfRows ')' )?
        ( '.bind(' PlaceholderValues ')' )*
        ( '.execute()' )?
</pre></b>
<b>Examples:</b><br>
In all cases assume a collection object, myCol, has been retrieved from the session.<br>
Pay particular attention to how quotes have been used.
<pre>
    myCol.modify().set('name',"Jim").exexcute();  // Caution: sets all documents to have a key called "name" with a value "fred"
                                                  // If the key is not present it will be created.
    myCol.modify().unset('name').execute();       // Caution: removes the key, "name", from all documents in the collection
	
Array handling: assume the following document structure
	
    {
        "_id": string
        "name": string
        "colleagues": [string, string, ...];
        "workHistory": [{
            "job": string,
            "from": timestamp,
            "to": timestamp
		},{
            ...
        }]
    }

	// Insert a new string at the start of the colleagues array for the doc with the _id "123456"
	// and then update the workHistory by appending a workHistory element
    var myId = "123456";
    var myJob = {
        "job": "MySQL Engineer",
        "from": new Date().getTime(),
        "to": new Date(2019,12,31).getTime()
    };
	
	// Perform the inserts - note the use of a bind variable for _id only
	myCol.modify('_id = :p1').arrayInsert('colleagues[0]',"Thea").bind("p1",myId).execute();

	// Append a the workHistory element, myJob
    myCol.modify('_id = :p1').arrayAppend('workHistory',myJob).bind("p1",myId).execute();    
</pre>
<b>Notes:</b><br>

The return value from the execute() will detail how many rows and items have been affected. 
It will also provide a count of warnings and a corresponding array of warning strings with severity levels.<br>
It should be possible to bind the objects being appended/inserted into arrays - a conversation with Development is ongoing...

<a name=removeFunction><h3>Delete => remove()</h3>
<b><pre>
    CollectionRemoveFunction 
      ::= '.remove(' SearchConditionStr ')'
        ( '.sort(' SortExprStrList ')' )? ( '.limit(' NumberOfRows ')' )?
        ( '.bind(' PlaceholderValues ')' )*
        ( '.execute()' )?
</pre></b>
<b>Examples:</b><br>
In all cases assume a collection object, myCol, has been retrieved from the session.
<pre>
    myCol.remove('_id = "12345"').execute();    // removes the document with the _id of 12345 from the collection

    myCol.remove('age &lt 25').execute();       // removes all documents that have an age key with a value of less than 25

    var myvar = 29;
    myCol.remove('age &gt :p1').bind("p1",myvar).execute();    // With objects rather than literals we can use binding
</pre>
<b>Notes:</b><br> 
For reasons of clarity the above examples detail node.js code <b>without</b> the use of Promises. In the real world this code 
will need to be wrapped by either traditional Promise code or the new async-await syntax otherwise results will be difficult to
capture and use.<br> 
The return value from the execute() will detail how many rows and items have been affected. 
It will also provide a count of warnings and a corresponding array of warning strings with severity levels.<br> 
Regardless of language you should use bind() when having to make multiple deletions.
